	<h1>Trade Friction Between U.S. And China -- What Happened And How Does It Affect The Two Sides? </h1>

	<div class="ui container segment">
	<h2>What Happened So Far?</h2>
		<div class="ui vertical sgement image"><img src="images/TwoRounds.png" alt="" ></div>
	<p>The U.S. announced it would implement a 25% tariff on 15 June 2018 on Chinese imports that had amounted to $50 billion in 2017. And China responded the same $50 billion will go to effect the same day in a tic-for-tat manner to this U.S. tariff action. </p>
	<p>In reaction to the Chinese retaliation, the U.S. announced that it would impose 25 percent tariff on another $200 million worth of Chinese goods. In quick reply, China promised to respond with 25 percent tariff on $60 billion more of U.S. imports. </p>

	<p>Tariffs are additional taxes on imported goods. Trump, wanting to encourage the domestic industry, imposed tariffs, which can drive up the price of foreign goods and theoretically allow domestic products a better chance to compete. That's why Trump slapped tariffs on aluminum and steel from foreign countries. According to the data from Bureau of Labor, U.S. unemployment rate drops to 3.7% in August 2018, lowest in more than 10 years. Therefore, tariffs probably helped make more jobs in the U.S.</p>

		<h2>China’ s Trade Surplus With U.S. Keeps Going Up in 2018, Despite The Tariffs </h2>

		<p>According to the plots above, China’s trade surplus with U.S grew generally during the last decade, except 2009 and 2016, and it surpassed the previous record in 2017. Since June 2018, when the trade tension started to elascalate, the year-over-year China’s trade surplus with U.S. kept going up, which widened to a record in August. It is strange because the trade friction widened, rather than reduced, the deficit of U.S. with China, at least from a holistic perspective. Is it real that a trade war based on bluster? Let’s see the specific categories of what U.S. exported to China. </p>

	<h2>What did the U.S. export to China in 2016?</h2>
	<div class="ui vertical segment image"><img src="images/category.png"></div>
				<div class="ui vertical segment">
					<p>Soybeans accounts for the most proportion of what U.S exported to China, followed by aircrafts.$27 billion of U.S. agricultural exports have been adversely aﬀected by Chinese tariffs implemented on 6 July 2018, and the U.S. planned a $12 billion farm bailout to in aid to agriculture industry, more than 3.6 billion will go to soybean farmers. </p>
					<p>It seems that the influence on the market of China is not as much as that of U.S. probably because the second round of tariffs against China will not go into effect until the end of 2018. Though not showing the data of what China exported to U.S., it should not be ignored the export restrictions of the US side on high-tech products, which may not be obvious in a short period.</p>

				  <h2>Position of China</h2>
					<p>Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed that unilateralism and economic hegemony are unacceptable, and threatening and putting pressure will only be counterproductive. The door of the Chinese side to dialogue and negotiation has always been open.</p>

				  <h2>Time To De-escalate</h2>
					<p>Tariffs often means retaliation and a resulting trading war. 2018 US midterm election is coming closer. Trade tension could become a major political drag. If countries continue to match the U.S. tic for tat with their own tariffs, consequently citizens would feel it even deeper in their wallets. it is better to de-escalate the tension of trade friction if a deal could be made by negotiation</p>
